# Don't Plagarize

### Basic Info

Apparently the website wasn’t even created by this developer :O who made it??

*not in flag format*

### The Breakdown

If you got the previous Archaeology challenge then you have already a masted the art of time travel.

Using this great power, all we do is hop back in time on the main branch commit dubbed "init"

![alt main_branch_init](../images/main_branch_init.png)

We see that Boris' best friend is Raob Dasliedčyk and he is a "cool front end designer" but did he create the website?

Going one more back to "removed image" gives us this

![alt removed_img](../images/removed_img.png)

Confirming that Raob Dasliedčyk did in fact create the website because Boris took the image from the home page and tried implementing it himself  
*(side note: you can also tell that Boris does not know what he doing based off of the boiler plate code and random copied and pasted css)*

### Solution
Raob Dasliedčyk
