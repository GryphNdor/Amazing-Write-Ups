# Developer Hunt

### Basic Info
Who created the verycoolwebsite?

*note: Many of the recon challenges will not be in flag format*

*note 2: This is the developer mentioned in the rest of the recon challenges*

#### Hint 1: 
 > Did you check the website top to bottom? 

#### Hint 2: 
> Ever wonder where the default Discord emojis come from ðŸ¤”?

### The Breakdown

The question here is referring to this website ([verycoolwebsite](https://verycoolwebsite.freedomctf.org/)) which was in reference to a previous challenge *Sloppy Auth* which featured a client side secured flag.

When looking at the website something should immediately tell you that something is off. 

The title of the actual website does not match the "verycoolwebsite" title.

![alt cool](../images/doolbah_is_cool.jpg)

This shouldve sent many questions into your head like: "what is doolbah?", "who is doolbah?", etc, etc.

Perhaps this wasnt super obvious but only a couple of the big social media sites use the *@* symbol to call reference to a user.  

**Twitter** and **Instagram**  

Since the second hint asks us where Discord emojis come from, a quick Google search gives us:

![alt finding_doolbah](../images/finding_doolbah.png)

This links us here: [twemoji](https://github.com/twitter/twemoji) and we know it is Twitter.

To get around logging in we just input our boy ***@doolbah*** into the search box like so: https://twitter.com/doolbah and we got our guy.

Hint 1: Was referencing the title of the website in the header tag and the footer as the bottom, once you looked at the title you had to do some Googling

Hint 2: Explained with Twemoji

Common Errors: 
* Trying to straight up Google @doolbah. Sorry guys we dont have that much clout
* Trying to plug in the flag to Sloppy Auth, yea there was another secret :P
