### The Breakdown

This one is probably one of my favorite challenges and it's unfortunate that very few people managed to solve it.

BTW here is the original track: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDmCxcLdzqQ

If you listen closely you can hear a muffled voice in the background.

It sounds like server something???

But if you try reversing the audio you can hear the flag clear as day

### Solution
flag{reverse_lofi}
