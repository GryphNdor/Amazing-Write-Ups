# How Puzzling

### Basic Info

We managed to dig up a lot of pieces from the flag, all you have to do is piece it together

#### Hint
>The first two letters in the beginning of one piece are the last two letters of the end another. Puzzle starts with "thi"

### The Breakdown
Yeah I messed this puzzle up. Normally it would all be scrambled but the flag is painfully obvious in the file. Oops :P
